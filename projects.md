# Academic

## CyberPhysical AOP

I am currently a member of a working group for this project. The goal of this project is the development of Cyber-physical systems that can operate on the concept of Always On Platform (AOP). We aim to develop a complete system that includes software and hardware developed, a stack of protocols, with models, devices and energy management. In particular, it is the intention of the group members to produce a platform to operate on different wireless networks and low power consumption.

## CodeDrip

In this project we developed a data dissemination protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks. We used a technique called Network Coding to improve energy efficiency, reliability, and speed of dissemination. Network coding allows recovery of lost packets by combining the received packets thereby making dissemination robust to packet losses.

## Organizer Baxter

This is a project I did while studying robotics at UC Berkeley, in the Fall semester of 2013. The goal is to use Baxter, a robot built by Rethink Robotics, to keep some objects placed in a table organized. It memorizes the original position of the objects in the table. When it detects that an object has been moved from its original position, it actuates to grasp this object and put it back in the position where it was before.

## Out to the World

[\[Website\]](http://www.outtotheworld.com)

This is a website to collaboratively gather coming out stories posted on YouTube. The goal is to make it easier for LGBT people to find such videos. Other people's stories of when they came out serve as inspiration to those who are still in the closet. The website was built on Google App Engine, using Python.
