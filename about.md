I'm Nildo. I am a student living in [Belo Horizonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte), Brazil. I am doing my Master's in Computer Science, at [UFMG](http://ufmg.br). I am advised by professor [Marcos Vieira](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~mmvieira). My research is in the area of Computer Networks and Embedded Systems. I am working on communication protocols for wireless cyber-physical systems. I have worked with protocols for multi-radio wireless sensor platforms. And I developed a dissemination protocol using a technique called Network Coding, which we published at the [European Wireless Sensor Networks Conference](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ewsn14/), in 2014.

I studied for one year at the [University of California at Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu), in the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semesters. I was participating in the Brazilian Scientific Mobility Program as a fully-funded scholarship recipient. In the Summer of 2014 I did an internship at [Tarana Wireless](https://www.taranawireless.com/), where I developed software for a new generation of wireless transport solution and designed and developed hardware tests on a embedded system's boot loader.

After I finish my Master's, I am planning on getting into a PhD program outside Brazil. I want to get even more experience with different education systems. After my PhD, I want to become a good professor. I like creating new things, and I really like teaching. So, it will be a perfect career for me.
